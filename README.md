# 42-Berlin-Engine

An experimental LLM inference engine implementing **DeepSeek Sparse Attention** and **Google Nested Learning**.

## Status

**Work in Progress** ⚠️

Tested with **Ministral 3B Reasoning**. The engine is functional but not yet ideal — Ministral's vision capabilities sometimes cause the model to confuse itself. Ongoing improvements are being made across the board.

## Features

- **Sparse Attention**: DeepSeek-style sparse attention mechanism
- **Nested Learning**: Google's nested learning approach
- **C Core**: Written in C for performance
